## Packages/Libraries Needed

`pip install Flask flask_cors flask_sqlalchemy psycopg2`

Axios is used to connect the Javascript front end to the Flask backend. Axios is already included in the html file.

## How to Run

- Run the Postgres F2DbT Database
- Run the Flask backend from the a terminal window in 'App/Backend/': `python app.py`
  _CHECK THAT THE BACKEND IS RUNNING ON PORT 5000_
- Run index.html from the 'App/Frontend/' folder using live server in VSCode or whatever HTML editor used.

Code is pretty messy, but should be functional and just needs to be polished up :)

Let me know if there's any questions!!
